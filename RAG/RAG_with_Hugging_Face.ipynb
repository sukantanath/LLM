    "Imagine you've been hired to help the HR department build an intelligent question-answering tool for company policies. Employees can input questions such as \"What is our vacation policy?\" or \"How do I submit a reimbursement request?\" and receive instant, clear answers. This tool would save time and help employees understand complex policy documents easily, by automatically providing relevant information instead of searching through pages of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you'll delve into the advanced concept of Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG), a cutting-edge approach in natural language processing that synergistically combines the powers of retrieval and generation. You will explore how to effectively retrieve relevant information from a large dataset and then use a state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence model to generate precise answers to complex questions. By integrating tools such as the Dense Passage Retriever (DPR) and the GPT2 model for generation, this lab will equip you with the skills to build a sophisticated question-answering system that can find and synthesize information on-the-fly. Through hands-on coding exercises and implementations, you will gain practical experience in handling real-world NLP challenges, setting up a robust natural language processing (NLP) pipeline, and fine-tuning models to enhance their accuracy and relevance.\n"
